# PCIP-3ï¼šPulsar Extended Transaction API Enhancement Proposal
# Background knowledge
When users consume messages using the Fail-over subscription mode and confirm messages using cumulative Ack, duplicate consumption may occur. In this case, even if users use Transaction, they cannot achieve Just-Once.
As shown in the figure below, in failover mode, the two consumer1 and consumer2 started simultaneously frequently undergo two disconnection switches.
Finally, Consumer1 consumed M1, M2, M4, M5; Consumer2 consumed M1, M2, M3. M1 and M2 were consumed twice.

# Goals
Solve the problem of cumulative ack consumption duplication by designing a new transaction API.
Why not fix this issue in the Pulsar main repository?
- The complexity of fixing problems without modifying the Client API is high, and the problem-solving cycle is long.
- There are indeed many confusing usage postures for existing transaction APIs
  - For example, the abort () and commit () methods may seem synchronous in name, but they are actually asynchronous. In actual use, you need to use abort ().get () and commit ().get ().
- Modifying the Client API in the Pulsar main repository is a difficult task because we cannot determine whether the new solution is necessarily perfect, and the time cycle for updating the API is long.
  The benefit of solving this problem in the contributor repository is:
- By wrapping the original Transaction API, this problem can be solved in a concise way. This wrapping can be seen as a best practice that does not affect the use of existing users, while providing a reference solution for users who encounter similar problems.
# High Level Design
Design a new API to place the context of message sending and consumption within Transaction, which not only solves the problem of repeated consumption, but also retains sufficient scalability for possible optimization in the future.
- Solve the problem of repeated consumption - use the function of individual ack messagelist to batch ack messages instead of the original cumulative ack.
- Retained sufficient scalability - sending messages requires using Transaction to construct messages, and consumed transaction messages are recorded in Transaction. Later, more optimizations can be added using this information without changing the interface.

## Public-facing Changes
### Public API
The org.apache.pulsar.txn.api.Transaction interface is an optimized and extended transaction interface designed to enhance usability and clarity in the Pulsar contributors' library. It addresses issues with CumulativeAck and transactions not preventing repeated message consumption, and it refines ambiguous methods for better clarity. Key features include:
- Message Recording: Records messages in a transaction without automatic acknowledgment.
- Asynchronous and Synchronous Acknowledgment: Supports both asynchronous and synchronous acknowledgment of all received messages for specific consumers or across all consumers.
- Transactional Message Builder: Creates a new transactional message builder for a given producer to construct and send messages within a transaction context.
- Committing and Aborting Transactions: Offers both asynchronous and synchronous methods to commit or abort transactions, ensuring the effectiveness of message sends and acknowledgments.
- Transaction ID and State Retrieval: Provides methods to retrieve the unique transaction ID and its current state to determine the transaction's lifecycle phase.

# Get started
## Quick Start
```java
public void transactionDemo() throws Exception {
String pubTopic = "persistent://public/default/my-pub-topic";
String subTopic = "persistent://public/default/my-sub-topic";
String subscription = "my-subscription";

// Create a Pulsar client instance
PulsarClient client = SingletonPulsarContainer.createPulsarClient();

// Create a Transaction object
// Use TransactionFactory to create a transaction object with a timeout of 5 seconds
Transaction transaction =
TransactionFactory.createTransaction(client, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS).get();

// Create producers and a consumer
// Create two producers to send messages to different topics
Producer<String> producerToPubTopic = client.newProducer(Schema.STRING).topic(pubTopic).create();
Producer<String> producerToSubTopic = client.newProducer(Schema.STRING).topic(subTopic).create();

// Create a consumer to receive messages from the subTopic
Consumer<String> consumerFromSubTopic = client
.newConsumer(Schema.STRING)
.subscriptionName(subscription)
.topic(subTopic)
.subscribe();

// Send a message to the Sub Topic
producerToSubTopic.send("Hello World");

// Receive a message
Message<String> receivedMessage = consumerFromSubTopic.receive();
MessageId receivedMessageId = receivedMessage.getMessageId();

// Record the message in the transaction
transaction.recordMsg(receivedMessageId, consumerFromSubTopic);

// Forward the transaction message to the pub topic
// Use the transaction message builder to forward the received message to the pubTopic
transaction.newTransactionMessage(producerToSubTopic).value(receivedMessage.getValue()).send();

// Acknowledge all received messages
// Acknowledge all messages received from the subTopic within the transaction
transaction.ackAllReceivedMsgs(consumerFromSubTopic);

// Commit the transaction
// Commit the transaction to ensure all recorded messages and acknowledgments take effect
transaction.commit();

// Close the consumer, producers, and client to release resources
consumerFromSubTopic.close();
producerToSubTopic.close();
client.close();
}
